# QPSK_Project_DC
This repository presents a QPSK digital communication project for the EE1123 course at JK Lakshmipat University. It covers QPSK theory, transmitter–receiver design, constellation analysis, and BER performance over an AWGN channel using MATLAB and Simulink, validating its bandwidth efficiency and reliability.
